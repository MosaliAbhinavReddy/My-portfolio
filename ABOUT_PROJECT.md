#  About This Project: Personal Portfolio

This is a fully responsive, animated **personal portfolio website** built using modern frontend technologies like **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**. It showcases my professional profile, resume, and project experience — specifically tailored for my background as a Computer Engineering student with a focus on semiconductor and Design Verification.

##   Purpose

To present my academic and project experience in a clean, professional format and make it accessible via a public URL (e.g., Vercel or GitHub Pages). It includes my resume, GitHub, LinkedIn links, and project portfolio.
